# PandemicControlApp

[![Build Status](https://github.com/TheLe0/PandemicControlApp/workflows/Android%20CI/badge.svgp)


This is a simple app for use on supermarkets, events, partys or others establishments during the pandemic, to control and know exactly how much people are inside, to
prevent the virus to spread easily

## The App

Is only compound by 2 activities, the main and the user preferences one.

* Main Activity

The main activity is where the user will increase and decrease the counting and go to the user preferences. This is all the user can do in the activity, is very simple and intuitive.

## COUNTRIBUTING

This app is very simple and the code may be a little coupled. This was my first Android app, build all by myself, I'm a little new to the Android and mobile in general development. So be free to contribute, give me advices and new ideas.
The app is not distributed, can only be used local, by a single user. This is a new feature to be implemented as a future work.
